<body>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

<p>
FileX Manager is an Android file management application that allows users to manage files stored on their device and optionally connect to third-party cloud services such as Google Drive.
</p>

<h2>Google User Data Access</h2>
<p>
When you connect your Google Drive account, FileX Manager accesses Google user data strictly to provide user-initiated file management features such as browsing, uploading, downloading, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and folders.
</p>
<p>
FileX Manager does not access Google Drive data unless the user explicitly connects their account and initiates actions within the app.
</p>

<h2>Data Protection and Security Measures</h2>
<p>
FileX Manager implements the following safeguards to protect Google user data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>OAuth 2.0 is used for secure authentication with Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Access tokens are stored only on the user’s device and are never transmitted to external servers.</li>
  <li>All communication with Google APIs occurs over encrypted HTTPS connections.</li>
  <li>No Google user data is stored on developer-controlled servers.</li>
  <li>The app follows the principle of least privilege and accesses data only as required to perform user-requested actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>
FileX Manager may store the following data locally on the user’s device:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>OAuth access tokens required to maintain the Google Drive session</li>
  <li>Temporary file metadata and cache to improve performance</li>
</ul>
<p>
This data remains solely on the user’s device and is not shared with the developer or third parties.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>
FileX Manager retains Google user data only for as long as necessary to provide its functionality:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access tokens and cached metadata are retained only while the Google Drive account remains connected.</li>
  <li>When the user disconnects their Google Drive account, all associated tokens and cached data are deleted immediately from the device.</li>
  <li>Users may also delete all locally stored data at any time by clearing the app’s data or uninstalling the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>
FileX Manager does not retain Google user data after account disconnection.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
FileX Manager does not sell, rent, or share Google user data with third parties. Data is disclosed only if required to comply with applicable laws or legal processes.
</p>

<h2>User Control</h2>
<p>
Users have full control over their data and may revoke Google Drive access at any time through:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The FileX Manager app (disconnecting the account)</li>
  <li>The Google Account security settings</li>
</ul>
